# text_game

## PURPOSE (first commit)
This project began as a fun way to incorporate the topics covered in Launch School's Object-Oriented Programming
course for Ruby Language. There are a number of classes defined which add the basic functionality to the game.

## EARLY VERSION (current code)
Currently, there are only two types of monsters shuffling the rooms in this infinite dungeon, and they carry a
small number of weapons and other treasure which are ripe for the taking. The player grows in strength as they
clear the dungeon of monsters - there are not currently any story elements for the game.

## IN FUTURE VERSIONS
All this functionality will be moved to the front-end using Javascript. The back-end will use Ruby to facilitate
player authorization, saving game progress, and returning JSON objects to populate the game with monsters, rooms,
and items.
