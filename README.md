# text_game

# Early version (first commit)
# This project began as a fun way to incorporate the topics covered in Launch School's Object-Oriented Programming
# course for Ruby Language. There are a number of classes defined which add the basic functionality to the game.

# Currently, there are only two types of monsters shuffling the rooms in this infinite dungeon, and they carry a
# small number of weapons and other treasure which are ripe for the taking. The player grows in strength as they
# clear the dungeon of monsters - there are not currently any story elements for the game.

# IN FUTURE VERSIONS
# - Lines with the `eval` method will be updated to use closures such as blocks or procs. This is in line with the
#   next section of Launch School's Ruby Learning Materials.
# - Additional libraries for monsters and treasure items will be added and abstracted away from the main code base.
# - Functionality for creating a map and revisiting old rooms will be added.
# - A basic test suite will be added and expanded upon as the game grows in complexity.
# - The code will be properly packaged in preparation for networking the application.
